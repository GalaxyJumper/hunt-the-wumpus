This our Hunt-The-Wumpus game, Ocean Edition.

It is like the original wumpus, with a few minor and a small amount of major modifications.
1. Wumpus is scarier, and does not die
    a. In order to win, you need to shoot a picture of wumpus, like how you would shoot wumpus with an arrow. After doing this, get out while being pursued by wumpus
    b. An escape plan is invaluable in this situation.
2. New tile = Alert tile
    a. Alerts the wumpus to where you are: Good luck!
