This is a java game titled "In the Deep" created by our team at Bothell High School for Microsoft's 'Hunt the Wumpus' challenge. You must navigate through a maze of underwater caverns, avoid deadly hazards, skirt death by the power of your wit, and ultimately strike the Wumpus dead the only way we know how: 1200 pounds of TNT and tetrodotoxin, delivered gracefully by our "reposessed" Mark 14 torpedoes.

"In the Deep" plays like the original "Hunt the Wumpus", with a few minor gameplay modifications:
Trivia Questions: when encountering any hazard, positive outcomes are determined by successfully answering randomly ordered, themed, trivia questions.

Pits and Bats have been changed to Abyss and Currents while Wumpus remained the same. Players receive a warning when adjacent to these hazards.
